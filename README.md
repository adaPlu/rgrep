# rgrep
A basic rgrep function created for CSE 31
Background grep is a UNIX utility that is used to parse or search through strings for a particular pattern. The strings can be either put in through the console or in text files. It is a very convenient way to look for basic patterns or ones with wildcards. It is fairly complicated to support the full character set that grep is capable of. So in this project, I will only implement a restricted grep, rgrep.

Usage ./rgrep 'pattern'

Usage with .txt file: ./rgrep 'pattern' < filename.txt
